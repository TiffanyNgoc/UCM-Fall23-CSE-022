Message:
Dear Trudy Johnson,

Greetings from sunny Hawaii! I hope this postcard finds you well. I wanted to share a glimpse of the breathtaking beach I'm lounging on right now. The sand is warm, the water crystal clear, and the palm trees sway in the gentle breeze. It's like paradise here!

I've been trying all the local cuisine, from fresh pineapple to delicious seafood. Yesterday, I even tried surfing for the first time - quite an adventure! I'm also meeting wonderful people and soaking up the Hawaiian culture.

Wish you were here to enjoy this tropical paradise with me. Sending you warm wishes from afar. Can't wait to catch up and share more stories when I'm back.

Take care!

Warmest regards,

Ruth Williams
